Destinations
============

Plaza+ adds 5 textboxes to the chatrooms.
You can switch between textboxes by pressing up and down, or by clicking the colored tabs above the textbox.
Each textbox is set to a destination (chat by default), which can be changed by using certain commands.
These commands usually accept a message, which will use the destination once without setting it.
The commands are found below:

``/chat [msg]``
	Chat. Simple as that.
``/echo [msg]``
	Mostly for testing, this will repeat your messages back to you.
``/whisperto <user> [msg]``
	Whisper a user.
