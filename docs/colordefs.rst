Color Definitions
=================

When specifying colors, Plaza+ uses the `TinyColor <https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor>`_ library to interpret several different color formats.
This is used for cSplit, username color, and online list colors.
Plaza's standard HEX format can be still be used along several color names and other formats.
Plaza+ will also accept ``random`` as an input, replacing it with a random color.
